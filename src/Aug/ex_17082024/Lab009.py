# What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

In
Python, the ^ operator is the
bitwise
XOR(exclusive
OR) operator.
It
performs
a
bitwise
comparison
between
two
integers, comparing
each
bit
of
the
numbers.

XOR
compares
corresponding
bits
of
two
numbers.
It
returns
1
for each position where the bits of the operands differ
and 0
where
they
are
the
same.
