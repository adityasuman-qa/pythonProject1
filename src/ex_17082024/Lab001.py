# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

'=' is the assignment operator.
It is used to assign a value to a variable.
for example:
x = 5
This means that the variable x now holds the value '5'.

'==' is the equality comparison operator.
It is used to compare two values to check if they are equal. For example:
x == 5
This checks if the value of x is equal to 5
and returns True or False depending on the comparison.
